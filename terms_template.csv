TERM,SCHEMA
Natural Selection, Mechanism of evolution; Survival of the fittest; Differential reproduction A process in nature in which organisms possessing certain genotypic characteristics that make them better adjusted to an environment tend to survive  reproduce  increase in number or frequency  and therefore  are able to transmit and perpetuate their essential genotypic qualities to succeeding generations.
Mutation, Genetic variation; Random changes in DNA; Point mutation; Frame-shift mutation A permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene  such that the sequence differs from what is found in most people. Mutations range in size; they can affect anywhere from a single DNA building block (base pair) to a large segment of a chromosome.
Genetic Drift, Random change in allele frequencies; Founder effect; Bottleneck effect The variation in the relative frequency of different genotypes in a small population  owing to the chance disappearance of particular genes as individuals die or do not reproduce.
Gene Flow, Migration of genes; Introduction of new alleles; Horizontal gene transfer The transfer of genetic variation from one population to another. It can occur as a result of migration of individual organisms that reproduce in their new populations  or the movement of gametes (e.g.  through pollen transfer among plants).
Adaptation, Evolutionary process; Beneficial traits; Environment-driven changes A process by which organisms become better suited to their environment through the accumulation of beneficial traits  which are propagated at higher rates through generations due to the survival advantage they confer.
Speciation, Formation of new species; Reproductive isolation; Genetic divergence The evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species  generally due to genetic divergence and reproductive isolation.
Founder Effect, Genetic drift; Reduced genetic diversity; Small founding population The loss of genetic variation that occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population. It is a case of genetic drift.
Bottleneck Effect, Genetic drift; Reduction in population size; Loss of genetic variation A sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental events or other catastrophic events  leading to a loss of genetic variation and a smaller pool of individuals to reproduce.
Allopatric Speciation, Geographic isolation; Divergent evolution; Genetic isolation A mode of speciation that occurs when biological populations of the same species become vicariant  or isolated from each other to an extent that prevents or interferes with genetic interchange  often due to geographical barriers.
Sympatric Speciation, Speciation within the same geographical area; Niche differentiation; Reproductive isolation A process through which new species evolve from a single ancestral species while inhabiting the same geographic region. In this process  new species are formed without a physical barrier to gene flow.
Peppered Moths,Industrial Revolution; Melanism; Natural Selection A classic example of natural selection where peppered moths in industrial areas of England evolved from light to dark forms due to pollution darkening the tree barks thus providing better camouflage against predators.
Galápagos Finches,Darwin's finches; Adaptive radiation; Beak variation A group of about fifteen species of finches that Charles Darwin studied on the Galápagos Islands. These birds are famous for their remarkable diversity in beak form and function which has been driven by differences in food sources on the islands.
Cichlid Diversification,African Great Lakes; Speciation; Diverse feeding strategies Cichlid fish in Africa's Great Lakes exhibit a striking array of sizes shapes and behaviors. This diversification especially evident in their feeding structures is a powerful example of adaptive radiation and speciation in isolated ecosystems.
Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria,Evolution in real-time; Antibiotic overuse; Survival of resistant strains The rapid evolution of bacteria to develop resistance to antibiotics particularly due to overuse and misuse of these drugs. This is a contemporary example of natural selection where resistant bacterial strains survive and multiply.
Charles Darwin, Origin of Species; Natural selection Charles Darwin's groundbreaking theory proposing that species evolve over time through the process of natural selection where individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce.
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Inheritance of acquired traits; Use and disuse An early theory of evolution proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck which suggested that organisms could pass on traits acquired in their lifetime to their offspring. Although largely superseded by Darwinian evolution it was influential in early evolutionary thought.
