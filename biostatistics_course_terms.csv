TERM,SCHEMA
Descriptive Statistics,"Summary of data; Includes measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation; Foundation of data analysis. Definition: Statistical techniques that describe and summarize data sets. Example: Summarizing exam scores to find the average performance of a class."
Inferential Statistics,"Techniques to infer properties of a population; Includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and p-values; Basis for decision-making. Definition: Methods to make predictions or inferences about a population based on sample data. Example: Estimating the effectiveness of a new drug based on sample trial results."
Probability Distributions,"Describes the likelihood of different outcomes; Includes normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions; Essential for statistical modeling. Definition: Mathematical functions that represent the probabilities of various outcomes. Example: Using the normal distribution to model exam scores in a large student population."
Linear Regression,Analyzes the relationship between two variables; Estimates coefficients of the linear equation; Used for prediction and inference. Definition: A statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Example: Predicting a student's final grade based on hours studied.
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance),Compares means among three or more groups; Tests for significant differences; Used in experimental design analysis. Definition: A statistical technique that assesses potential differences in a scale-level dependent variable by a nominal-level variable having 3 or more categories. Example: Comparing the effectiveness of different teaching methods on student performance.
Biostatistical Design,"Planning of biological experiments; Ensures valid, reliable, and efficient results; Includes sample size determination and randomization procedures. Definition: The process of creating a study that robustly tests a hypothesis in biology. Example: Designing a clinical trial to test a new cancer treatment's efficacy."
Survival Analysis,Analyzes time-to-event data; Includes techniques like Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards model; Important in clinical trials and reliability testing. Definition: A branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration until one or more events happen. Example: Estimating the survival time of patients after receiving a particular treatment.
Meta-Analysis,Combines results from multiple studies; Increases statistical power; Used in evidence-based practice and review articles. Definition: A statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies. Example: Assessing the effectiveness of antidepressants across different clinical trials.
Control Group,"Group in an experiment where the independent variable is not applied; Serves as a benchmark for comparison. Definition: A standard of comparison for checking or verifying the results of an experiment. Example: In a drug trial, the control group receives a placebo to compare against the treatment group."
Randomization,Process of randomly assigning subjects to different treatment groups; Reduces bias and ensures groups are comparable. Definition: A method used to prevent selection bias by randomly allocating participants to different groups. Example: Randomly assigning students to different teaching methods to study the effect on learning outcomes.
Blinding,"Technique to prevent bias by concealing group assignments from participants, researchers, or both; Key in clinical trials."
Sample Size Determination,Calculating the number of participants needed to detect an effect with a desired power and significance level; Critical for study validity.
Replication,Repeating studies or experiments to verify results; Essential for reliability and scientific validity.
Factorial Design,Experimental setup that allows studying the effects of two or more factors simultaneously; Explores interactions between factors. Definition: An experimental design used to evaluate multiple factors and their interactions at the same time. Example: Testing the effect of fertilizer types and watering frequency on plant growth.
Cohort Study,Observational study where subjects are followed over time; Examines risk factors and outcomes. Definition: A longitudinal study where a group of individuals is observed over a period to determine how certain exposures affect outcomes. Example: Following a group of smokers and non-smokers over time to study the incidence of lung cancer.
Cross-sectional Study,Observational study that analyzes data from a population at a specific point in time; Useful for prevalence assessment. Definition: A study design where data are collected at one point in time from a sample to describe a population. Example: Surveying a population to determine the prevalence of obesity.
Case-control Study,Observational study that compares subjects with a condition (cases) to those without (controls); Assesses risk factors. Definition: A study that compares patients who have a disease or outcome of interest (cases) with patients who do not have the disease or outcome (controls). Example: Comparing lung cancer patients to healthy individuals to identify risk factors.
Biosafety Levels,Standards for laboratory practices to ensure safety when handling biological materials; Ranges from BSL-1 to BSL-4 based on hazard level. Definition: A set of biocontainment precautions required to isolate dangerous biological agents. Example: Using BSL-3 practices for research involving tuberculosis bacteria.
